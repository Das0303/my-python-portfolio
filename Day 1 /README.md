## Day 1: Solving a Pay Calculation Problem

### The Problem :

Write a program to calculate pay, including overtime.
- The user provides the total hours worked.
- The regular rate is $10/hour.
- Any hours over 40 are paid at 1.5 times the regular rate.

### Output :

### My Analysis:

I encountered a common type error where the input() function returned a string instead of a numerical value. This caused the multiplication operator to perform string duplication rather than the intended mathematical calculation.
To resolve this, I implemented type casting using the int() function to convert the string input into an integer. I also corrected the logic to properly calculate the total pay by summing the regular hours' pay with the overtime hours' pay.
